For this project I want to add a simple chatbot
to the regattaresults website that will make it easier for people to retrieve specific results
.
Users will prompt the chatbot for a specific race ex, "JM14B sculls" , and the chatbot
will either direct them to the link for that specific result or open it for them.


These are what I will be using
- Any IDE of choice lmao
- Python for the chatbot logic
- Node.js for frontend chatbot widget

-Web scrapping regattaresults, lol not usre if legal-
